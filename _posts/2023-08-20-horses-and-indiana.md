I'm reading [Empire of the Summer Moon](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/S-C-Gwynne/dp/1416591060) by [Sam Gwynne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._C._Gwynne). It is a very interesting book about [Comanches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche) and [Cynthia Ann Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Ann_Parker). The long title of the book is ["Quanah Parker and the Rise and Fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/9781849018203).

Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the Native Americans of Indiana had never encountered horses. Horses were introduced to North America by Spanish explorers in the 16th century, and their use gradually spread to different parts of the continent. Indiana began using horses extensively during the early period of European settlement, as did many other regions of the United States. Horses quickly became an important part of Native American culture, allowing for more efficient hunting, trade and travel.
