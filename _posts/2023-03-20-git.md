## To check out a remote and create a local branch with the same name
   ```bash
   git checkout -t remotes/origin/KIA_PL4_Q
   ```
   Note: switch `t` is important

## Add an SSH key in gitlab:
  - Login->avatar->setting->SSH Keys
  - Copy public key there (e.g. with xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)

## Change the message of the most recent commit that has not been pushed:
  ```console 
  git commit --amend -m 'new message'
  ```
## Add remote repository
  edit `.git/config` add  the following lines
    ```console
    [remote "sys01"]
                  url = user@url:project-or-group/rest-of-adress/
                  fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/system/*
    ```
  With cmd:
    ```console
    git remote add my-remote-name user@url:project-or-group/rest-of-adress/
    ```    
  
  ## To check out  a file from other branch to this branch
    ```console 
    git checkout origin/other-branch file.txt
    ```
    Note in the above example, the path `file.txt` is relative to current path, i.e. if you are in dir1 folder then you need to call it from the same folder
    ○ Note: you need to `git pull` before run this command even using remotes/origin instead origin doesn't help!
  
  ## Change remote url based on access-token:
   ```console 
  git remote set-url origin https://oauth2:glpat-sYYxs9V1Kxp-jFbeG_zZ@gitlab.subdomain.de/group/datasets/proj.git
  ``` 
  - aouth2 in the above example can be everything else!
  
  ## To remove the last local commit which is NOT PUSHED
    ○ git reset HEAD~1
  
  ## To remove the last local commit which is PUSHED (no body worked there after you)
    ○ git reset --hard sha-which-you-want back
    ○ git clean –f –d #clean everything with force
    ○ git push –f # push with force
  
  ## To rename master to main
    ○ git branch –m master main # -m for move/rename
    ○ git push –uf origin main # -u is `--set-upstream`
    ○ git push --delete origin master # note: it shouldn't be protected and default branch 
  
  ## See diff staged/added file:
    ○ git diff --staged # or –cached
  
  ## Ignore file mode:
    ○ `git config core.fileMode false`
  
  ## remote branch deleted, but still it appears in 'branch -a'
    ○ git fetch –p #remove any remote-tracking refs
  
  ## To add a file-type as lfs to repository
    ○ git lfs track "*.lib"
    ○ Don't forget to upload gitatribute too!
  
  ## Fingerprint has already been taken gitlab
    ○ Produce a new sshkey-gen
    ○ Make a file with the name config in .ssh
    ○ And write the following there 
    Host           gitlab.com
HostName       gitlab.com
IdentityFile   C:\Users\<user name>\.ssh\id_rsa
User           <user name>
    Host           gitlab_2
HostName       gitlab.com
IdentityFile   C:\Users\<user name>\.ssh\id_rsa_psl1121
User           <user name>
    ○ Use git clone git@gitlab_2:userrrnameee/drawing.git
  
  ## Project Access Token
    ○ Note: the role of token should be developer, otherwise it hasn't access to pull.
    ○ I created a token with Guest role with reading repo, but it doesn't work
